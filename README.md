# Nanocats Peddie

This application was made for the 2024 PeddieHacks by the group NanoCats

# Running the code
Follow the deployment link: idksarah.github.io/Songify/ and enter a song name/artist. Originally, the app would search the song for you and display the album cover, spotify link, title, and artist, but it is currently being reworked to find a song, provide the lyrics, allow the user to highlight their favorite lyrics, and then provide a song recommendation based off of that. However, the UI remains similar enough that this change should not be too big an issue. </br>
